Hello there! 😊 I’m Judy, a software engineer and veteran investment professional—

⭐️ 7+ years of experience within the finance and technology space. I'm passionate about flexing my creative software development muscles by working on full-stack applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, and more. I co-created an open source developer tool called Tetrachrome that enables devs to visualize the full-stack of their applications and recently gave a tech talk on GraphQL in the context of APIs (watch it here: https://vimeo.com/801327493).

🔑 Excited to continue perfecting my craft in software and fintech, be it working with clients, managing projects, or writing code. In my free time, you can find me doing HIIT workouts (Orangetheory 🍊), reading fiction 📚, or eating out at the most delicious spots🍴. If you’re interested in learning more about my journey, give me a follow!
